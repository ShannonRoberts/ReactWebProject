# React Web App
This is a project a made while learning react.  
The purpose of the web app is to be a template for a business or professional to showcase their work and services.
I currently have it based on a design company but this could be easily changed!  
The website is reactive with animations and features a fullscreen slideshow on the home page and lightbox for the portfolio.
